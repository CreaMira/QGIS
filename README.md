## Assessment of the herbicide efficiency on treating invasive species: the case of reed canary grass using machine learning.
*Note:* go over to the `qgis-app` branch to look at the source code for the QGIS app & GUI. DO NOT MERGE that branch with `maximum-likelihood` or `random-forest `branch. The 3 different branches in this repo have different functionality and usecases.
